work supporting Madeleine Hackney's CDA2 "OMT"

Krish has asked that we have Madeleine shoulder-surf:

>Hi Krish and Bruce (cc: Madeleine),

>I'm just writing to close the loop on a change we made today: per Krish's request Madeleine will shoulder-surf me while I process her data at my pace (i.e., non-pedagogical). 

>Prior to this I've been processing her data without her, and then meeting with her to preview her results before presentation to the mentors. Bruce's intention for that arrangement was to decouple her pilot progress from her training pace, and it sounds to me like this new arrangement preserves that intention while giving Madeleine some additional exposure.

>best,
>Stephen
