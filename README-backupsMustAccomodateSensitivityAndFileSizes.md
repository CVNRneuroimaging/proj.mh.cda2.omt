- In each of the parent folders for this project's files (01.projectDesign ...
04.deliverables), there is a text file named "00.README-aboutThisFolder.md"

- That file contains a description of the folder's contents, and characteristics
that should be considered when making decisions about backup methods. Backup
methods are likely to vary across the folders.

- I designed the schema with the intention that all sensitive files
(PII/PHI/VA-sensitive data) are stored in the folder named
"collectedData-TREAT_AS_SENSITIVE". This includes recruiting and retention
data.
